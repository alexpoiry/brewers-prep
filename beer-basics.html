      <p><strong>What is Beer?</strong></p>
<p>I should start by saying the words are imperfect. The term "beer" isn't perfectly scientifically defined.
Some people may have valid reasons to consider some type of things beer while excluding others.
Very generally speaking, beer is an aloholic beverage produced via a process known as brewing which contains 4 ingrediants.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Water</li>
  <li>Grain</li>
  <li>Bittering/Stabilizing Agent</li>
  <li>Yeast</li>
</ul>

<p>The most common grain used to make beer is barley, though wheat, rye, rice, maise, and other cereal grains are used.
The most common bittering/stabilizing agent is hops, though mugwort, heather tips, gruit herbs, and other fruit extracts are used.
The most common yeasts are ale and lager yeast, though wild/uncultivated yeasts are also used.</p>

<h3>Beer Brewing</h3>
<p>Brewing is the process by which live yeast cultures consume the sugars found in cereal grains, converting it into ethanol and carbon-dioxide.
Cereal grains are high in carbohydrates and need to be malted to convert those carbohydrates into simple sugars that yeast consume.
The malting process is a natural process in the cereal grain.
After exposing the grain to moisture the grain releases an enzyme that breaks down the carbohydrates into simple sugars that it would normally use to grow into a new plant.
We start that process by then halt it before the grain sprouts and begins to grow.
We will then usually roast the malted grain to bring out different flavors.
Next, we introduce hot water to dissolve the sugars and produce a substance we call wort.
This process is known as mashing.
The wort is basically sugary water and other compounds from the malted grain.
The wort is then cooled so we can add live yeast.
Like any organism, yeast can only survive within a range of temperatures and the boiling temperatures used to generate wort would kill them.
Before adding the yeast we add bittering/stabilizing agents like hops.
This is necessary because, while wort is good for yeast it is also the ideal environment for bacteria.
Bittering/stablizing agents make the wort less hospitable to bacteria but allow the yeast to work until the ethanol renders the beverage generally inhospitable to microbial life (yeast included).</p>

<h3>The Primary Types of Beer</h3>
<p>In general beers can be grouped into 3 types based on the yeast used in the fermentation process.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ales</li>
  <li>Lagers</li>
  <li>Other</li>
</ul>

<p>Technically the first beers humans ever produced fall into the "Other" category.
These used wild yeast cultures that are everywhere in our environment.
Worts were simply left exposed to the air and these wild yeasts blew in on the wind and colonized the wort.
These wild yeasts can have highly varied flavor profiles and results.</p>

<p>While no one knows for certain, some wild yeasts, either via cultivation/selective breeding or simple luck, started to out compete other yeasts in the brewing process.
These eventually became ale yeasts.
Ale yeasts are known as top-fermenters becuase they rise to the top of the wort and produce a noticeable foam.
Ale yeasts also tend to thrive in warmer conditions: 18-24&deg;C or 65-75&deg;F.
They are known for producing esters and phenols.
Esters often produce fruity flavors while phenols produce spicy and complex aromas.</p>

<p>Eventually, more complex and intentional breeding of yeast lead to the production of lager yeasts.
Lager yeasts are bottom-fermenters because they settle to the bottom of the wort.
Lager yeasts do well in cooler temperatures: 7-13&deg;C or 42-55&deg;F.
It is the ability to thrive in lower temperatures that gives lager yeast its name.
The German word <em>lagern</em> relating to storage, as in a cool spot such as a cellar.
Lager yeasts produce fewer esters and phenols resulting in cleaner, crisper flavors.</p>
