  <h2>Welcome to the Beer Tutor</h2>
  <p>
    This site is designed for beer lovers, homebrewers, and anyone studying brewing styles to sharpen their knowledge, 
    specifically those wanting to prepare for the BJCP Beer Judge Certification.
    You&apos;ll find quick quizzes based on official beer style guidelines (a fun way to test yourself), get familiar with style names,
    and learn to recognize the huge variety of beers out there.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here&apos;s how it works: Select one of the links to the left.
    That will allow you to test your specific knowledge of beer based on the focus.
    For example, the Brewers Association Styles will allow you to test your knowledge of styles of beer that are related to specific beer type.
    You can then drill down into those styles and really check that you know all its characteristics.
  </p>

    The site isn't perfect, but I wanted to make it available to some friends so they could started on the BJCP prep.
    Got an idea for a new quiz? Found something that could use an update? Interested in a new feature?
